    <p>God is the Creator and Ruler of the universe. He has eternally existed as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The three are coequal and are one God.</p>

    <h2>Jesus is the Son of God.</h2>

    <p>He is coequal with the Father and Holy Spirit. Jesus lived a sinless human life and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all people by dying on a cross. He arose from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over sin and death. He ascended to Heaven and will return again someday to earth to reign as King.<p>

    <h2>The Holy Spirit lives in each Christian from salvation.</h2>

    <p>The Holy Spirit is coequal with the Father and the Son of God. He is present in the world to make people aware of their need for Jesus Christ. He provides Christians with power for living, understanding of spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right. He gives every believer spiritual gifts when they are saved. As Christians we seek to live under His control daily.</p>

    <h2>The Bible is God's Word to us.</h2>

    <p>The Bible was written by human authors, under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs about living. Because it is inspired by God, it is truth without error.</p>

    <ul class="default">

      <li><a href="https://bible.com//111/Pro.30.5.niv" target="_blank">Proverbs 30:5</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>People are the supreme object of God's creation.</h2>

    <p>People are made in the spiritual image of God, to be like Him in character. Although every person has tremendous potential for good, all of us are marred by an attitude of disobedience toward God called "sin." Sin separates us from God and causes many problems in our life.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Salvation is God's free gift to us, but we must accept it.</h2>

    <p>We can never make up for our sin by self-improvement or good works. Only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God's offer of forgiveness can anyone be saved from sin's penalty. When we turn from our self-ruled life and turn to Jesus in faith we are saved. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into his life by faith.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>People will exist eternally with or without God.</h2>

    <p>People were created to exist forever. We will either exist eternally separated from God by sin or eternally with God through forgiveness and salvation. To be eternally separated from God is hell. To be eternally in union with Him is eternal life in Heaven. Heaven and hell are real places of eternal existence.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Baptism is symbolic of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ.</h2>

    <p>Once we have accepted Jesus as our Lord and Savior, baptism is a way for us to publicly declare our new life in Christ. It is also a step of obedience based on God’s commands and allows us to follow the example of Jesus, who submitted himself to baptism to "fulfill all righteousness."</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>In addition to Essential Beliefs, we have liberty in Non-Essential Beliefs.</h2>

To his own master he stands or falls… So then each of us will give an account of himself to God… So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God.' cite='Romans 14:1,4,12,22' %}

    <h2>Life.Church is part of the Evangelical Covenant Church (ECC).</h2>

    <p>The Evangelical Covenant Church (ECC)—a rapidly growing multi-ethnic denomination in the United States and Canada with ministries on five continents of the world. Founded in 1885 by Swedish immigrants, the ECC values the Bible as the Word of God, the gift of God's grace and ever-deepening spiritual life that comes through faith in Jesus Christ, the importance of extending God's love and compassion to a hurting world, and the strength that comes from unity within diversity.</p>

    <p>What makes the Covenant unique from other denominations is the fact that while it strongly affirms the clear teaching of the Word of God, it allows believers the personal freedom to have varying interpretations on theological issues that are not clearly presented in Scripture.</p>
