      <p class="lead">Our mission is to lead people to become fully devoted followers of Christ. That's how we're able to make a difference, and it's the driving force behind everything we do.</p>
      <p>A church isn't a building—it's the people. We meet in <a href="/locations/">locations</a> around the United States and <a href="http://live.life.church">globally online</a>. No matter where you join us, we think you'll find friendly people who are excited to get to know you!</p>

      <p>Wherever you are in life, you matter and you have a purpose. We want to help you become the person God has created you to be. Your journey has a next step and we'll help you find it. It could start with <a href="/serving/">serving</a>, finding <a href="/chazown/">God's vision for your life</a>, <a href="/giving">giving</a>, or <a href="/locations/">joining us regularly</a>.</p>
      <p>You don't have to take the next step alone. With a strong community of friends, you can laugh, grow, and serve with people who genuinely care about you. Find a small group, <a href="/lifegroups/">or LifeGroup</a>, to join you on your journey.</p>

      <h2>Your family</h2>
      <p>Strong families start with solid foundations. That's why we partner with parents to help raise the <a href="/kids/" title="LifeKids.tv">next generation</a> to become followers of Christ. Your children and teens have opportunities throughout the week<link to Kids & Youth> to grow relationships with each other and with God.</p>

      <h2>Our community and world</h2>
      <p>We are passionate about serving the global community and demonstrating God's love to others. Whether in person or online, individually or in groups, within our church and around the world, we are focused on supporting and engaging in relationships that provide <a href="/lifemissions/">relief and restoration</a> to a hurting world.</p>
