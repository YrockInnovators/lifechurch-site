      <p>How different would the world look if everyone got what they deserved? Would your salary be the same? What would our prisons look like? Would nice guys finish first or last? God knows what we deserve. See if that's what we get in <em>I Deserve It</em>, an all-new series starting Easter weekend.</p>
