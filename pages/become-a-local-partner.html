    </header>
    <article>

      <p>Thank you for your interest in partnering with Life.Church to restore our community. The process of becoming a Life.Church local mission partner begins with a conversation between the organization and the LifeGroups and Missions Team at a Life.Church campus to discuss potential service opportunities and then continues when the partner completes an official application to become a Life.Church partner.</p>
      <p>We will review the prospective partnership to ensure the volunteer roles are restorative and clearly defined, and then evaluate the organization’s standing to ensure we are able to grant funding. When the organization is approved, a one-year agreement is signed and Life.Church gives a grant to the new partner organization. Partnerships are renewed annually.</p>
      <p>Throughout the year, the partner and campus team work together to recruit individuals to become involved with the organization. The partner provides training, guidance, and support to each volunteer. We want to help our partners become more effective, so we share feedback that we receive through our volunteer survey about their experience.</p>
      <p>Learn more about our approach to local missions by reading our Missions Principles and watching Restore, a three-session video series that guides individuals to identify, evaluate, and commit to what God has called them to do in their communities.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">How Funding Works</h2>
        <p>We believe that relationships drive change. We want our attenders to engage with our partner organizations to build the relationships that drive change and our heart is to support those organizations financially. In the first year of partnership, we will provide a $5,000 grant to the organization. If the partner continues to meets the expectations, the partnership will be renewed each year which will include an annual grant between $5,000 and $80,000 depending on the number of volunteers that are involved. We are extremely excited about the impact of mobilizing people and funds to restore our communities.</p>
