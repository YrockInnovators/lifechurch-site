        <h2>HOPE International</h2>
        <p>HOPE International focuses on alleviating physical and spiritual poverty through microenterprise development in 16 countries around the world.</p>
        <p>HOPE International programs provide Christ-centered microfinance and savings, along with education. Microfinance isn't a handout but a hand-up. It requires ownership and active participation from the beneficiaries. Microloan recipients can take pride in knowing that their own hard work has made the difference between poverty and provision for their families.</p>
        <p>LifeChurch.tv provides support to HOPE International’s global work.</p>
