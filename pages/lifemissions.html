        <h2>Tearfund</h2>
        <p>Tearfund has one mission: to end poverty around the world. By following Jesus where the need is greatest, Tearfund is ending poverty and rebuilding communities in more than 50 countries on five continents around the world.</p>

        <p>By working through the local church, Tearfund isn't just meeting people's physical needs, but their spiritual needs as well. Because they are embedded in the community, they are able to identify opportunities for restoration within the community itself.</p>

        <p>Through this approach, they have successfully combatted hunger, human trafficking, gender inequality, injustice, access to healthcare, and more.</p>

        <p>Life.Church helps to fund Tearfund's work around the world.</p>

        <h2>HOPE International</h2>
        <p>HOPE International focuses on alleviating physical and spiritual poverty through microenterprise development.</p>
        <p>HOPE International programs provide Christ-centered microfinance and savings, along with education. Microfinance isn't a handout—it’s a hand-up. Microloan recipients take ownership and actively participate in the program. They take pride in knowing that their hard work has made the difference between poverty and provision for their families.</p>
        <p>Life.Church supports  HOPE International’s global work in 16 countries around the world.</p>

        <h2>The Chalmers Center</h2>
        <p>The Chalmers Center's vision is for local churches to declare and demonstrate to people who are poor that Jesus Christ is making all things new. The Center focuses on  redefining poverty based on biblical truths by training U.S. churches to respond to the complexities of poverty within their communities and training international savings groups about managing their businesses, households, and health.</p>
        <p>Using a relational, biblical worldview, Chalmers' Microfinance With Education is a powerful intervention program designed to help churches respond to the complexities of poverty within their communities. Life.Church helps to support the Chalmers Center's international work and US church training as well as partners with its staff in the development of training tools such as <em>Helping Without Hurting.</em></p>
