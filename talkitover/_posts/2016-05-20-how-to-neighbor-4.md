Key Scriptures

_"So do not fear, for I am with you..."_  
Isaiah 41:10 NIV 

# How do we love the lonely?

## 1.	Love with **touch**.
_A man with leprosy came and knelt before [Jesus] and said, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.” Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy._

**Matthew 8:2-3 NIV**

## 2.	Love by **listening**.
_[Jesus] asked them, “What are you discussing together as you walk along?” They stood still, their faces downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” “What things?” he asked. ..._

**Luke 24:17-19 NIV**

## 3. Love with **time**.
_So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand._

**Isaiah 41:10 NIV**

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* How much time per day are you alone? No people, phone, music, TV, book, or anything. Just you. 
* Think about Craig’s message for 30 seconds. What one thing do you remember? Is it causing you to do anything different?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* How will the concept of relational poverty make you think or act differently?
* Can you think of someone who's lonely? What are some practical ways you can you act like Jesus and love them? 
* What do you think are the greatest contributing factors to loneliness in yourself and people you know? 
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* How have you replaced true relationship with forms of "deferred loneliness"? Give some examples.
* Share about a time someone simply listened to you and it was exactly what you needed. How can you listen more?
* Do you ever feel lonely? How will you invite people into your life?
* Time, listening, and touch. Which of these three can you get better at giving? To whom? 

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about caring for children.</p> 

[Joshua 1:5](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jos.1.5.niv) [Hebrews 13:1-3](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/heb.13.1-3.niv) [Proverbs 20:5](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/pro.20.5.niv) [Psalm 71:9](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psalm.71.9.niv)

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

_Holy Spirit, please empower us to overcome our relational poverty. Help us ditch deferred loneliness and engage in real relationship with people in front of us. Also, will You show us specific people You’d like to comfort through us? Amen._
