## Always A Way Out
<p class="lead">Think back through Craig's talk. What stuck out?</p> 

Key Scriptures

_No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it._  
1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV

[Hebrews 4:15](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/heb.4.15.niv) [1 Corinthians 10:12](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1co.10.12.niv) [James 1:13-15](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jam.1.13-15.niv)

### Four Truths About Temptation

1. It’s not a **sin** to be **tempted**.  
2. You are never **above** temptation.  
3. God will **never** tempt you.  
4. There is **always** a way **out**.

"Temptation is anything that promises satisfaction at the cost of obedience to God."  

"Every temptation is an invitation to depend on Christ."

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* What food tempts you most? Donuts, cheeseburgers, baked kale, something else?
* Tell a funny story about getting caught. Cookie jar, anyone?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* Think about your last temptation. Was there a way out? How can you get better at taking the way out?
* Think of something you do that’s not outright beneficial. Talk about what it may be costing you.
* Read Hebrews 4:15. Do you think of Jesus this way? How does knowing He’s been tempted in every way help you?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* How often does what Craig described as “false guilt” trick you into giving up?
* Are there any areas of your life where you’re living like you’re above temptation? Identify common blind spots as a group.
* Do you see God as growing you when you struggle or causing you to struggle? How does this perspective affect you?
* Open up. What are some ways this group can help each other find a way out?

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

* Jesus, we may fall into temptation, but You died and rose so we could be free! We invite You to show us where we need a way out, and please strengthen us to go through it. Thank You, God, for this group of people to go through life with. Amen.
