## Break Me
<p class="lead">Think back through Craig’s message. What sticks out to you?</p> 

Key Scriptures

_While [Jesus] was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head._  
Mark 14:3 NIV

[Mark 14:22-24](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/mrk.14.22-24.niv)  
[Luke 22:19](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.22.19.niv)    

Broken and Poured Out

1. Her gift represented her **past**.
2. Her gift represented her **future**.

￼￼￼_“Your most effective ministry will come out of your deepest hurts.”_  

_“When the woman broke the jar, she didn’t hold back a single drop. When Jesus’ body was broken, He gave his whole life.”_

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* Name the most expensive thing you’ve broken. Okay, how’d you break it?
* What’s something you hate to see get poured out or wasted?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* What point do you think Mark was trying to make by putting the story of the woman and the Passover next to each other?
* Imagine you were in the room when this woman broke the $20K jar. How would you respond?
* Read Luke 22:19. What all do you think Jesus wanted us to do when He said, “... _do this in remembrance of me_”?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* Have you ever experienced the type of brokenness Pastor Craig talked about? What’s your story?
* Are you trying to stay strong in an area of weakness or hold on to something you need to pour out? What’s keeping you from giving it to God?
* Describe what a broken and poured out life could look like.
* How has God has used broken areas from your past to help others?

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

* Jesus, You’ve told us to keep doing what You did: be broken and poured out to bring people closer to God. Will You embolden us to really start living this way? Amen.

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about brokenness.</p>
