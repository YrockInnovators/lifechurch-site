Key Scriptures

_“I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but I will not be mastered by anything._ 

1 Corinthians 6:12 NIV

## How To Become an Addict

### 1. Don’t ever admit you have a problem.
Only acknowledge your guilt. Admit that you rebelled against the lord your God and committed adultery against him by worshiping idol... 
Jeremiah 3:13 NLT

### 2. Gratify your fleshly desires.
So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want.  
Galatians 5:16-17 NIV

### 3. Keep your addiction a secret.
Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy. 
Proverbs 28:13 NIV

### 4. Depend on your own power, never God’s.
...demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. 
2 Corinthians 10:5 NIV

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

*	It seems like everyone has a go-to comfort food. What’s yours?
*	Do you ever binge on shows, games, or even books? How do you feel after?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

*	Which of Craig’s four pieces of bad advice sounds the worst to you? Why? 
*	Read 2 Corinthians 10:3-5. Do you think you have divine power to demolish strongholds? How do you think this should apply to believers?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

*	Reflect on 1 Corinthians 6:12. Are you over-spending your time, energy, or other resources on anything that’s not beneficial? Why?
*	Have you ever become addicted to something? How did it start?
*	Have you ever been set free from something by the power of God? Can you share that story?
* Read [Galatians 5:1](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/gal.5.1.niv), We believe Jesus sets us free. Let’s pray together for freedom. What can we pray about?

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about motives.</p> 

[Galations 5:1](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/gal.5.1.niv) [Psalm 118:8](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.118.5.niv) [John 8:31-16](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.8.31-36.niv) [Romans 8:1-4](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.8.1-4.niv)

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

_God, when You speak, things happen. You also gave us the power to speak and demolish strongholds. So we’re talking to You now and asking You to set us free from empty obsessions. In the name of Jesus, amen._
