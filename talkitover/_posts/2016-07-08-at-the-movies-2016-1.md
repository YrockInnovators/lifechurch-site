Key Scriptures

Ecclesiastes 4:9-10  

_Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes._   
Nehemiah 4:14

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

*	Read Ecclesiastes 4:9-12. Can you think of any part of your life where you absolutely don’t rely on anyone else? Why or why not?
