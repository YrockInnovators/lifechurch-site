Key Scriptures

_Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: 10 If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up._   
Ecclesiastes 4:9-10  

_Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes._   
Nehemiah 4:14

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

*	What would you do if you won the lottery?
*	How much money do you think it would take to make your life better or easier?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

*	Read 1 Timothy 6:6-8. Food and clothing—what do you add to this list to be happy? 
*	Read Luke 12:16-21. What do you think it means to be rich toward God?
* Why do you think it’s so easy to go after temporary stuff instead of eternal treasure?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

*	Craig gave this bad advice: “Resent God’s goodness in everyone else’s life, and ignore His goodness in your own.” Can you identify? How?
*	If the way you live could speak, what would it list as the five things you value most? How do you feel about the list?
*	What is the one thing you think you need to be fully happy? Does it offer anything that Jesus can’t?
* Share about a moment when you realized Jesus was enough. What brought you to this moment?

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

_Jesus, You are enough. More than enough. Forgive us for looking beyond You and Your provision to try to increase our happiness somehow. Show us how to lean fully on You and Your Holy Spirit. Amen._
