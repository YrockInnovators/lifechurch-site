Key Scriptures

_No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide **a way out** so that you can endure it._  
1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV

[Galatians 5:16-17, 24-25](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/gal.5.16-17,24-25.niv) [Romans 8:12-13](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.8.12-13.niv)

* What you **feed** grows.
* What you **starve** dies.

### Overcoming The Appetites of The Flesh

* Depend on the **power** of the Holy Spirit.
* Follow the **prompting** of the Holy Spirit.

_"When you become full of God, you don't crave the emptiness of sin."_

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* Have you ever tried a free product or timeshare with no obligation to purchase? How’d that go?
* What’s your best story of feeling obligated to do something?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* Read Galatians 5:16-17. What do you think it means to "walk by the Spirit"?
* Is there anything you don’t want to do, yet you do it almost every day? Why do you think this happens?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* When was the last time you felt nudged by the Holy Spirit? What was the outcome?
* Swearing, overeating, lusting, overspending, cheating. Who are these actions intended to benefit? What do they feed?
* Is there something you feel powerless over? Have you invited the power of the Holy Spirit into this area?
* Share a story of a time when you leaned on the power of the Spirit to overcome temptation. What came of it?

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

* Holy Spirit, thank You for using conversation with friends to help us realize our dependence on You. We invite You to continue to nudge us this week. God, thank You for providing a way out!
