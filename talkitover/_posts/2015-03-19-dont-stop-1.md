## Don't Stop on Six
<p class="lead">Start by reviewing this week’s key points.</p> 

[Hebrews 10:36](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/heb.10.36.niv)

Three Reasons People Stop Short

1. Our **perspective** gets blocked.  
[Joshua 6:1-5](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jos.6.1-5.niv)  
_"Only God can speak in past tense about the battles you haven’t even fought yet."_
2. Our **progress** isn’t always obvious.  
[Joshua 6:6-14](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jos.6.6-14.niv)  
_"God doesn’t want you to trust in your progress, He wants you to have faith in His promise."_
3. The **process** is open-ended.  
[Joshua 6:15-16,20](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jos.6.15-16,20.niv)  
_"Do you trust that God is working even when what you’re doing doesn’t seem to be working?"_

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">How far do you want to take your group? Choose from these suggestions to tailor the discussion to suit your group.</p>

* Have you ever written a sappy poem like Steven did for Craig? Care to recite a line?
* Do you have a dream or goal you stopped short of reaching? Share the first one you think of.
* What is a wall that’s blocking your perspective and stopping you short?
* What is a part of your life where God’s promise doesn’t match what you see.
* How can we incorporate perspective-altering worship into our week?
* Can you identify with Joshua’s armed men? What are some healthy behaviors you repeat daily without noticing progress?
* Take some time to point out and encourage each other’s persistence.
* What are you facing that requires you to just “shut up and march” without seeing the outcome or knowing the distance?
* Have you ever trusted your progress more than God's promise? Why do you think that happens?
* Say a prayer together asking God to use the wall in front of you to do His work inside of you.

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End with a challenge to take action. Choose a closing question to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

* What concept keeps playing over in your mind? Say it out loud and ask the group to identify a simple action plan with you.
* Remind each other throughout the week to spend less time talking about the size of life’s walls and more time talking about, reading about, and walking in God’s promises.
* Read this seven-day Bible reading plan about overcoming walls: [go2.lc/walls](https://www.bible.com/reading-plans/992-walls-fall-down-gods-unusual-plan-for-victory)
