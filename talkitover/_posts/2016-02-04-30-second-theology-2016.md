## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* Is your team the winner this week? If not, what’s your favorite team? Do you even care?
* Which was your favorite commercial? What life changes does it inspire you to make?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* What are some ways our LifeGroup could help “invisible” people to feel needed and known?
* Read Psalm 118:24. Are you living like these are the good ol’ days? If not, what keeps you from focusing on today?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* Do you ever feel like Mindy Kaling from the Invisible commercial? Read Isaiah 53:3. How does this passage make you feel?
* What are some things you've said, "Never!" about? What could make you change your mind?
* If you’re married, are you having the time of your life? How can you “be what you want” as Craig said?
* Parents, how do your children see God in you? What are some ways you’re winning? What are some ways you can improve?
* How can we be available to people in abusive situations?
* Imagine you could only pay with love. How would your financial status change? Who'd you be in debt to?

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

* Father, will You give us the strength to live out the ideas we’ve discussed about being stronger dads, couples, friends, and followers after You? Teach us to be a church where people can belong before they believe. Amen.

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">Start doing. Commit to a step, and live it out this week.</p>

* Craig asked us to pick the message we identify with. Which commercial and message will you act on? How?
* Dads and parents who want to step it up, start this Bible Plan. [go2.lc/12mistakesplan](http://go2.lc/12mistakesplan)
* Couples, check out _From This Day Forward_. [go2.lc/couples](http://go2.lc/couples)
