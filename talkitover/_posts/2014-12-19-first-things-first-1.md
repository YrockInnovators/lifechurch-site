## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start with an icebreaker question to get everyone talking. Then choose questions that will work well with your group.</p>

* When you walk into a grocery store, what do you get first, what do you get last?
* What was your longest lasting New Year’s resolution?
* Share what you wrote for the kind of 2014 you had. What contributed to your answer?
* Have you put God first in your day for a consistent period of time? What differences did you notice?
* What’s your greatest barrier to starting your day with God?
* Why do you start your week with church (even if it starts Saturday night)?
* How can you bring church into the rest of your week?
* How does giving God the first 10% affect the other 90%?
* Have you ever fasted? What happened?
* Which of the four firsts would make the biggest difference in your 2015? Why did you pick that one?
* What’s your first step to put God first in your life? What specifically will you commit to this week?
