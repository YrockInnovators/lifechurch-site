## I Believe in God, but Don’t Know Him
<p class="lead">Think back through Craig’s talk. What stuck out?</p> 

Key Scriptures  
[1 John 2:3-4 NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1jo.2.3-4.niv) [Matthew 7:21-23 NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/mat.7.21-23.niv) [Galatians 4:8-9 NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/gal.4.8-9.niv) [Psalm 63:1-4 NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.63.1-4.niv) [Psalm 9:10 NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.9.10.niv) [Ephesians 1:16-20 NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/eph.1.16-20.niv)

_They claim to **know God**, but their actions **deny him**_. ... Titus 1:16 NIV

### Some Believe In God ...

... but don’t **know** Him.  
... and **know** Him, but don’t know Him well.  
... know Him **intimately**, and **serve** Him wholeheartedly.  

"Many of us are informed about Jesus but are yet to be transformed by Him."

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start Talking: find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* Fess up. Who’s someone famous you know almost everything about, but don’t really know them?
* Do you know God like Craig knows Amy, or like Craig knows George Brett?

<p class="lead">Start Thinking: ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* Think of someone you know whose life exclaims the existence of God. Describe why.
* On a scale of 1-10, where 1 is “all talk,” and 10 is “all walk,” how much do you live like God exists?
* If you had to put it into categories, what parts of your faith are cultural tradition and what parts come from closeness to God? 

<p class="lead">Start Sharing: choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* Where does your faith land: don’t know Him, know Him but not well, or know Him intimately and serve Him wholeheartedly?
* Where do you want your faith to be? What are some life changes that could help you get there?
* Has the Holy Spirit ever prodded you, comforted you, or strengthened you? Share a story of closeness to God.
* What do you most often call God, and how often do you talk with Him? How does this define your relationship with Him?

<p class="lead">Start Praying: be bold and pray specifically.</p> 

* Father, we need to know You better. Will you draw us to You? Holy Spirit, be our daily guide and strength. Jesus, move us from information to transformation. Thank You, Father!
