Key Scriptures

_Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”_  
Luke 5:29-32 NIV

_Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?” They came out of the town and made their way toward him._  
John 4:28-30 NIV

_He replied, “Whether [Jesus] is a sinner or not, I don’t know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!” Then they asked him, “What did [Jesus] do to you? How did he open your eyes?” He answered, “I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?_  
John 9:25-27 NIV

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* On a scale from 1 to 10, how confident are you in sharing your faith?
* Do you have any uncomfortable door-to-door type experiences like Craig’s? Let’s hear it.

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* What do you have that you could use to share your life and faith with others?
* Read Luke 5:29-32. What do you think about Jesus’ analogy of the healthy and the sick? How does this apply to you?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* Craig gave four reasons we don't share our faith. What are yours? What would make the difference for you?
* What is your story? Do you ever share it with others? What does that look like for you?
* Have you ever led someone to find Christ? Can you share that experience?

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray with power.</p> 

Jesus, what You did for us is something we’ve just got to tell people about. Will You open our eyes to the opportunities we have to reach out to people around us? We pray You would interrupt us with people who need Your love. Amen.
