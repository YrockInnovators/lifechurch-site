Key Scriptures

_Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”_
Luke 5:29-32 NIV

_Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?” They came out of the town and made their way toward him._
John 4:28-30 NIV

_He replied, “Whether [Jesus] is a sinner or not, I don’t know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!” Then they asked him, “What did [Jesus] do to you? How did he open your eyes?” He answered, “I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?_
John 9:25-27 NIV

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray with power.</p>
