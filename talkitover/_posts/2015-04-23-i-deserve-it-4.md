## I Deserve To Be Counted Out, But He Gave Me Another Chance
<p class="lead">Review the key points from Craig’s talk. What stuck out?</p> 

### The Story of Peter 
[Luke 22:54-62](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.22.54-62.niv) [John 21:15-17](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.21.15-17.niv) [1 Peter 4:16](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1pe.4.16.niv)

### Peter's Mistakes
_1. He underestimated his own weaknesses._<br />
_“Acknowledging weakness is the first step to true strength.”_

_2. He followed Jesus at a distance._


### What Did Peter Learn
_“Success isn’t final. Failure isn’t fatal.”_

_“Never put a period where God puts a comma.”_ 

_“Failure is an event—never a person!”_

_Peter lost: pride, arrogance, self-confidence, impulsiveness, and unreliability._

_Peter gained: deep humility, unshakeable confidence in God, and unwavering faithfulness._

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Where will you lead your group? Pick and choose from these suggestions to create the right discussion for your group.</p>

*	Do you have a funny story of the first time you remember feeling shame, or a most embarrassing moment? 
*	How often does shame impact your decisions? Often? Not too often? All the time? What parts of your life are affected?
*	Tell a story of a time you failed to live up to a commitment like the one Peter made to Jesus. How has this impacted you?
*	What weaknesses do you underestimate? How can you get more honest when you blow it?
*	What are some parts of your life you often find yourself defending to others? Are you underestimating a weakness?
*	In what ways are you following Jesus from a distance?
*	How hard is it for you to accept God’s grace? What can you do this week to accept a second chance for your mistakes?
*	Peter denied Jesus three times, but went on to kick off Christianity as we know it. Have you run from a failure where God would prefer a comma instead of a period?
*	What causes you shame today? Yelling at kids? Unavailable at home? Overindulgence? Dishonesty? Bring it to the open and pray together to accept God’s forgiveness.

*	Take out your phone to subscribe to this Bible plan and watch Peter transform from unreliable fisherman to fully devoted follower: [go2.lc/allthingsnew](https://www.bible.com/reading-plans/983-all-things-new)
*	Think of one person you know who seems stuck on past failures. Send them this week’s message and open up about how it’s changing your life. 
*	Has someone failed you? Use Christ’s example with Peter and reach out to forgive them this week.
