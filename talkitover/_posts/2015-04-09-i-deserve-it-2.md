## I Deserve Condemnation, But He Gave Me Mercy
<p class="lead">Review the key points from Craig’s talk. What stuck out?</p> 

The Woman Caught in Adultery [John 8:1-12](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.8.1-12.niv)

_"**Go now** and **leave your life of sin**."_ [John 8:11b](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.8.11.niv)

_So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus_. [Romans 8:1 NLT](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/rom.8.1.nlt)

_When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, "I am the **light of the world**. Whoever follows me will **never walk in darkness**, but will have the light of life."_ [John 8:12](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.8.12.niv)

"When the light of the world becomes the light of your world, you will never walk in darkness."

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Where will you lead your group? Pick and choose from these suggestions to create the right discussion for your group.</p>

* Remember Craig’s baby monitor story? What’s your version of a #worststoryever?
* Are comparisons or past failures bringing you shame? How do you form your view of yourself?
* Describe what you thought and felt in a moment that your shame—or the reason for it—was taken away.
* "You’re used goods." "This is just the way you are." "You’re a fake." What voices of condemnation do you hear?
* You don’t have to get caught to feel condemned. Describe a time when you brought your issue to the light and got freedom.
* What do you need to leave behind so you can "go and leave your life of sin"?
* When you catch people in their brokenness, do you look more like Jesus or the religious leaders?
* Why do you think we attach shame to certain sins more than others? How do you think this works against us?
* Read Romans 8:1 as a group. Do you live like this is true? How would truly believing this transform your daily life?

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End with a challenge to make it real. Commit to a next step as a group and bring the discussion to life this week.</p>

* This seven-day reading plan about overcoming guilt will strengthen your perspective of God’s grace: [go2.lc/guilt](https://www.bible.com/reading-plans/180-guilt)
* Are you holding a stone to throw at a certain person or group? Set it down this week and partner with Jesus to lovingly help people leave their sin behind.
* Ask the Holy Spirit to point out dark areas in your life where you need to trade condemnation for Jesus’ mercy and light. Pray together as a group and invite Jesus to free you.
