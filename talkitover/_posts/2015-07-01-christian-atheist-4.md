## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start Talking: find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* Name one thing that you’ll never be able to fully control (but wish you could). Weather, spouse, time, age, boss, hair, cat?
* What’s one of the most controlling things you ever do with people? What’s one of the most trusting things you ever do?

<p class="lead">Start Thinking: ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* What are some practical, everyday actions you identify as showing trust in God?
* Put these items in order of how well you trust God with each: relationships, family, money, forgiveness, health, protection.
* What are some specific ways your life might look different if God had your complete trust?
* Who do you know that trusts God fully? What sets them apart?
 
<p class="lead">Start Sharing: choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* I don’t fully trust God with _______. Fill in the blank with something, someone, or some specific way you aren’t trusting God.
* Tell a story of when you trusted God with something, and He came through in a way you didn’t expect.
* On a scale of 1 to 10—where 1 is knowing about God and 10 is knowing Him—where do you land today? Does this impact the way you trust Him?

<p class="lead">Start Praying: be bold and pray specifically.</p> 

* God, thank You for Your goodness, faithfulness, and love. Help us move from knowing about You to knowing You, and from believing in You to trusting in You fully.
