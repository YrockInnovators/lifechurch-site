Pride: a preoccupation with your own **importance**

_"Pride puts the creature in place of the Creator."_

[Jeremiah 9:23](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jer.9.23.niv)

Pride in what we **know**  
Pride in what we **do**  
Pride in what we **have**

Pride shows itself as:  
1. A critical **spirit**  
2. Self-**deception**  
3. **Comparisons**
