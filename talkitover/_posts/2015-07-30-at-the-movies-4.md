<p class="lead">Think back through Craig's talk. What stuck out?</p> 

**Key Scripture**

_Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed. If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble._   
Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 NLT  

**To Be Successful God’s Way:**  
1. You need someone to do life with.  
2. You need someone to invest in.  
3. You need someone to stay for.

This week’s movie is based on a true story about Jim White whose temper had lost him some coaching jobs. When White gave up coaching and took a teaching job, he didn’t know the poor, rural community would make him a better dad, husband, and coach.

"People matter more than things, relationships matter more than power, and love is what makes life worth living."

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start Talking: find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* Name three or four of the most successful people you can think of. What made you pick them?
* Did any scenes make you feel emotional or inspired? Why do you think they moved you?

<p class="lead">Start Thinking: ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* What changed inside of Coach White?
* Why do you think it’s so hard to see people as more important than status or things?
* Read Mark 12:30-31. Do you think Jesus was outlining success? How do you subconsciously define success?
 
<p class="lead">Start Sharing: choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* Have you ever experienced—first or second hand—a life change similar to Coach White’s? Share and discuss.
* Do you spend more time trying to get noticed for what you accomplish on your own or trying to notice what you can accomplish for others?
* What are some practical ways we can act more like a loving community?
* Can you honestly say you love your literal neighbor as yourself? How can you invest in your local community?

<p class="lead">Start Praying: be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

* Jesus, You set the bar when You said loving God and loving people are first priority. Will You forgive us for loving things more than people? Holy Spirit, put us in the middle of people’s lives and teach us to love like You first loved us. Amen.
