## Michael Jr.

<p class="lead">Think back through Michael Jr.’s talk. What sticks out?</p> 

Key Scripture:

￼_"Be still, and know that I am God ..."_  
Psalm 46:10 NIV  

**Hearing His Voice**

* It's not about what you do. It's about why you do it. But you can't know the _what_ or the _why_, without knowing the _who_.

* Be still, and listen for the Father’s voice.

* * *

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* Do you know a good joke? Let’s hear it.
* Which Michael Jr. bits had you laughing hardest?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* Read Luke 4:16-21. Did Jesus know His why? What is it? How does it apply to you?
* Read Psalm 46:10. What do you think is important about "being still" in front of God?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* Do you ever get your _what_, _why_, and _who_ (God) out of order? How does that look in your life?
* Are there any parts of your life that lack a _why_ behind them?
* Think back to the video Michael Jr. showed of his baby daughter. Do you know your heavenly Father’s voice like that? If you have one, share a story of a time you heard His voice.
* What's something you wish you could hear from God about?

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about hearing from God.</p> 

[John 10:27](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.10.27.niv) [Romans 10:17](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.10.17.niv) [Psalm 46:10](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.46.10.niv) [Luke 4:16-21](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.4.16-21.niv)

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

Heavenly Father, we really love it when we hear You through Your Word, in prayer, in worship, and as we go about our day. Will You continue to reveal Your heart and plans for us? We love You. Amen.
