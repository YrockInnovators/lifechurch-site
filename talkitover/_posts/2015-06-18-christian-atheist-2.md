## I Believe in God, but Don’t Fear Him
<p class="lead">Think back through Craig’s talk. What stuck out?</p> 

Key Scriptures  
[Psalm 36:1-2](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.36.1-2.niv) [Proverbs 9:10](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/pro.9.10.niv) [Proverbs 14:27](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/pro.14.27.niv) [Proverbs 22:4](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/pro.22.4.niv) [Genesis 22:12](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/gen.22.12.niv)

**Love** God + **Respect** God = Fearing God

### Blessings of the Fear of God

* _The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom_...  
Proverbs 9:10 NIV  
* _The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, turning a person from the snares of death_.  
Proverbs 14:27 NIV  
* _True humility and fear of the LORD lead to riches, honor, and long life_.  
Proverbs 22:4 NLT  

"The fear of the Lord is an ongoing attitude of my heart that moves me to choose over and over again to obey God when it’s easier to do something else."

"The greatest evidence of the fear of God is complete obedience to God."

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start Talking: find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* Have you ever made a Shrinky Dink? Do you even know what a Shrinky Dink is?
* What’s your gut definition of fearing God? How does the word “fear” make you feel about God?

<p class="lead">Start Thinking: ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* Do you think the Western perspective of fearing God is any different from a biblical perspective? Explain how it is or isn’t.
* Does your life reflect your understanding of God as a loving Father, or a righteous Judge? Do you think you need more balance? If so, how?
* How do you think you’d respond if God asked you to do something crazy like what He asked of Abraham and Isaac?

<p class="lead">Start Sharing: choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* Have you ever customized to what extent you obey God?
Share a story. How did it work out?
* Share a story of a time when your fear of the Lord led to a wise decision, a fuller life, success, honor, or health.
* In what area of your life are you not fearing and not obeying God? What are you going to do about it?

<p class="lead">Start Praying: be bold and pray specifically.</p> 

* Lord, help us to know You as Father, Friend, and Consuming Fire. Holy Spirit, reveal my broken places and give me the strength to submit them for healing. Thank You, Jesus, for making this possible.
