## I Deserve Rejection, But He Gave Me Acceptance
<p class="lead">Start by reviewing this week’s passage and key points.</p> 

_Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a **chief tax collector** and was **wealthy**. He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was **short** he could not see over the crowd. So he **ran ahead** and **climbed** a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way. When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, **come down immediately**. I must stay at your house today." So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly. All the people saw this and began to mutter, "He has gone to be the guest of a sinner." But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord! Here and now **I give half of my possessions to the poor**, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back **four times** the amount." Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and **to save the lost**."_ [Luke 19:1-10](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.19.1-10.niv)

**"When you seek Him, you will find Him!"**

**"Even if I’m rejected by people, I’m accepted by God."**
