Key Scriptures

_Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight._  
Proverbs 3:5-6 NIV

_Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar; so she said to Abram, “The LORD has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her.” Abram agreed to what Sarai said. So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife. He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. ..._  
Genesis 16:1-4 NIV

_Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus._  
Philippians 4:6-7 NIV

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* If you could actually have full control over something, what would it be?
* Who rules the TV remote in your house?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* Even if you've read Proverbs 3:5-6, read it again like you've never seen it before. How is this Scripture inconsistent with culture?
* Why do you think we tend to naturally choose control over surrender?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* In which areas of your life are you most controlling: family, work, money, friendships, or something else? How does this impact people you care about?
* Talk about the last time you felt completely out of control. What did you learn?
* Reflect on Abraham and Sarai’s story from Genesis 16:1- 4. Have you ever tried taking God’s plans into your own hands? How did that turn out?
* Share a past or present experience where you’ve given God your trust. How are you practically doing this? What does it look like to give this to God?

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray with power.</p> 

_Jesus, we’ve been trying to run our lives like we know better than You. Forgive us. Holy Spirit we invite You to loosen our grip on control. Father, we surrender our family, our finances, our work, to You. Amen._

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">Start doing. Commit to a step and live it out this week.</p>

* What are you trying to control? How can you surrender this to God? What's your step this week?
* Start the _I Choose_ Bible Plan and hear from others who are choosing surrender over control. [www.go2.lc/ichoose](http://go2.lc/ichoose)
* Write down the thing you’re trying to control on paper. Put this paper somewhere you spend time every day and repeatedly give it to God in prayer.
