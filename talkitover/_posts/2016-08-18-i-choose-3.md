Key Scriptures

_I don’t really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don’t do it. Instead, I do what I hate... I want to do what is right, but I can’t. I want to do what is good, but I don’t. I don’t want to do what is wrong, but I do it anyway... Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death? Thank God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord._  
Romans 7:15, 18b-19, 24-25 NLT

_Don’t you realize that in a race everyone runs, but only one person gets the prize? So run to win! All athletes are disciplined in their training. They do it to win a prize that will fade away, but we do it for an eternal prize. So I run with purpose in every step. I am not just shadowboxing. I discipline my body like an athlete, training it to do what it should. Otherwise, I fear that after preaching to others I myself might be disqualified._  
1 Corinthians 9:24-27 NLT

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* Have you ever signed up for a gym? How many times? How long did it last?
* Which is hardest to pass up? A tasty treat, a great sale, or mindless binge-watching?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* Craig said, “Discipline is choosing between what you want now and what you want most.” How does that statement play out in your own life?
* Why do you think our actions tend to favor the pain of regret over the pain of discipline?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* What do you want most? Invite God's guidance into your answer.
* What are some areas in your life where you feel you lack discipline? What will your life look like in five years if you don’t make changes?
* What goals could you set that would require you to rely on God's strength and grace?
* Share a story of when you were able to choose discipline over regret. What worked for you?

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray with power.</p> 

_Holy Spirit, we need your power. We are so weak. We know what to do, and then we do what we know we shouldn’t. Will you give us the ideas, power, and grace to stick with discipline? Amen._
