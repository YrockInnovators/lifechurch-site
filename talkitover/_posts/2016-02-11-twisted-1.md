Key Scriptures

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* What Scriptures do you most often see getting twisted?
* Talk about a time you prayed for something and God answered your prayer.

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* Think for a second before you answer. Do you most often try to apply truth from Scripture or try to apply Scripture to what you think is true?
* Read 1 John 5:14-15 together. What do you think it means to ask according to His will?
* How can you balance coming boldly to God in faith-filled prayer with also asking according to His will?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* Read Mark 11:24-25 together. Share about a relationship where you held a grudge. How did it impact your prayers?
* Craig talked about three things that might hinder your prayers: unforgiveness, wrong motives, or struggling faith. If you had to choose one of these to work on, which of these would you choose, and why?
* Who is someone you need to forgive? Have you tried asking for God’s strength to forgive them?
* Share a story of a time you asked and asked for something before you finally realized your motives were wrong.
* Read Matthew 9:29-30. Rate your faith on a scale of _none_ to _blind-eyes-are-being-restored_. What would build your faith?
* What is your biggest prayer request you have right now? Share it with your group, and pray for one another.

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p>
