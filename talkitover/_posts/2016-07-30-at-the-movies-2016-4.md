Key Scriptures

_Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ._   
1 Corinthians 11:1 NIV  

_... we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord, his power, and the wonders he has done. He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach their children, so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children. Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands_   
Psalm 78:4-7 NIV
