Key Scriptures

_“You shall not commit adultery._ 

Exodus 20:14 NIV

## How to Commit Adultery

### 1. Neglect your marriage.

### 2. Enjoy common interests and form an emotional bond with someone else.

### 3. Make excuses and rationalize your actions.

## Instead, do whatever it takes...

### 1. To radically reduce the risks.
Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house, ... Proverbs 5:8 NIV
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart
Matthew 5:28 NIV

### 2. To invest passionately in your marriage.
May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth. A loving doe, a graceful deer—may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be intoxicated with her love. Why, my son, be intoxicated with another man’s wife? ...
Proverbs 5:18-20 NIV

### 3. To visualize the potential destruction
For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave. 
Proverbs 5:3-5 NIV
