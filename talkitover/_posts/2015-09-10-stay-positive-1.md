Key Scriptures

_If you search for good, you will find favor; but if you search for evil, it will find you!_  
Proverbs 11:27 NLT

### 8 Reasons I’m Optimistic From Romans 8

1. My sins are forgiven, and my eternity is secure.
2. Jesus is at the right hand of God praying for me.
3. My future victory is greater than my present pain.
4. My mind is filled with the peace of God.
5. If God is for me, who can be against me?
6. God’s Spirit helps me in my weakness.
7. God’s working everything in my life for good.
8. Nothing can separate me from the love of God. 

"I'm optimistic not because of what I feel, not because of what I see, but because of what God says."
