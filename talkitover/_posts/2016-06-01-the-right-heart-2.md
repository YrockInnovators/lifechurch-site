<p class="lead">Think back to Joyce Meyer’s message. What sticks out?</p> 

Key Scriptures

_Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” And He said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the great and foremost commandment. The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets._ 

**Matthew 22:36-40 NASB**

_No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us._ 

**1 John 4:12 NASB**

## Key Thoughts
_"You can’t be selfish and happy."_

_"You can’t give away what you don’t have."_

_"Anything that remains stagnant dies. What He pours in, we must pour out."_

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

*	How many song titles can you think of about love? Ready, go!
*	If you could only preach one message, what would you want to tell people about God?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

*	What’s the difference between loving yourself and being in love with yourself? 
*	How can loving yourself help you love others?
*	Share a time when someone’s Christ-like love helped you see God in a new way. 
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

*	What’s something you really like about yourself? Is that hard or easy for you to share? Why do you think that is?
*	How could you step up your love factor with people who are difficult for you to love?
*	What are some examples in your life when selfishness has kept you from being happy?
* Who is someone you need to spend time paying attention to this week? What will you do to listen to and encourage them? 

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about motives.</p> 

[John 13:34-35](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.13.34-35.niv) [1 John 4:7-8](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1joh.4.7-8.niv) [Ephesians 3:19](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/eph.3.19.niv) [1 Corinthians 12:31](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1cor.12.31.niv) [1 John 3:17-18](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1joh.3.17-18.niv) [1 Corinthians 13:1-13](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1cor.13.1-13.niv)

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

_Jesus, we thank you so much for the love You’ve shown us. Help us to love the way You love. Help us individually and as a group to love in a way that shows You to the world. Amen._

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">Start doing. Commit to a step and live it out this week.</p>

*	"We can simplify our life by thinking more about love." What are some ways we can keep love at the top of our mind as we go through our week?
* What could our group do this summer to start a love revolution in our community? What can we do together that we wouldn’t be able to do on our own?
