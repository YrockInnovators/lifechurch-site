### A New, God-centered View of You

1. God will give you a new **name**.
2. God will give you a new **purpose**.
3. God will give you a new **future**.

"What’s true about you now doesn’t have to be true about you later."

"Refuse to let labels of the past limit God’s plan for your future.

"God’s power is bigger than your past. His truth is bigger than others’ opinions."

* Do you have any good tightwad stories like Craig’s?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* What are some labels—good or bad—you’ve held on to?
* What label used to be true about you but is no longer true?
* What is something you want for your future that would be limited by a current label?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* What negative labels are you believing? What’s God’s new
label for you?
* How does your new label change what you’re all about?
* Share a story of how God completely changed you or someone you love.
* ORead Luke 5:10 and Jeremiah 29:11. How can God use your past label to empower your new future?

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

* God, thanks for changing our name from lost to found, from rejected to loved, and from stuck to transformed. Holy Spirit, will You make our new labels stick as we go into this week? Amen.
