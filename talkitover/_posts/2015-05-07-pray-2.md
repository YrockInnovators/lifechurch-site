## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End with a challenge to make it real. Commit to a next step as a group and bring the discussion to life this week.</p>

*	Follow along with the _Pray Bible Plan_, and invite friends and family to do the same: [go2.lc/prayplan](http://go2.lc/prayplan)
*	Prayer will give you boldness to share, and it’s a way to share. Ask someone if they have something specific you can pray for. You’ll be surprised how often people say yes!
*	Add a dedicated prayer time—even if it’s five minutes—to your daily routine.
