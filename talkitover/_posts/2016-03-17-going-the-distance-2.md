## No Words Needed

<p class="lead">What stuck out to you from John Gray’s message?</p>

Key Scripture

_Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went to the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to eat. And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil, and stood at His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil. Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, “This Man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner.” And Jesus answered and said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” So he said, “Teacher, say it.”
“There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?” Simon answered and said, “I suppose the one whom he forgave more.”
And He said to him, “You have rightly judged.” Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head. You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in. You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil. Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.”_  
Luke 7:36-47 NKJV

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* “Planting some chrysanthemums?” Share a time when you went to a “stuffed shirt” kind of event. What was the most surface conversation you heard?
* “We won! We? You’re not on the team!” What team are you most connected to through your passion?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* How would your group respond if a stranger were weeping under the table? How should you respond?
* Jesus is worthy of our passion and commitment. How does your life reflect this hunger and thirst for Jesus? How could it reflect that passion more?
* Since “Jesus is bigger than politics,” how does your conversation during the week reflect this truth?
* “Ew!” Who are the kinds of people today who are seen as shameful like this woman was in her time? How can we offer them God’s amazing grace?
* “No words needed.” Does that mean we don’t need to share our faith? What did this title mean in context?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* Is your own circle too small to include the lost and hurting? Who are people in your circle who need Jesus?
* Since we are living letters (2 Corinthians 3:2), what version of Jesus do people see when they read your life?
* How has shame kept you from growing relationships? What about from pursuing Jesus?
* We all are broken. What brokenness has God’s amazing grace saved you from?
* How has your past given you the grace to love others?
* What desperation in your life leads you to worship? How will you pursue worship this week?

* * *

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">Start doing. Commit to a step, and live it out this week.</p>

* How can we make our group a place where people who need forgiveness feel welcomed?
* Set up an account and send friend requests to everyone in your group in the Bible App so you can grow during the week. Pick an Easter plan and start it together.
