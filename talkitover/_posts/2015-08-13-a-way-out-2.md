Key Scriptures

_No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide **a way out** so that you can endure it._  
1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV

[Hebrews 2:18](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/heb.2.18.niv) [James 4:7](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jam.4.7.niv)
