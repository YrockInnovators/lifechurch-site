Key Scripture

_Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world._  
James 1:27 NIV  

## The Church is "Plan A"

* Caring for children is a central theme of Scripture.  

_Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed. Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked._  
Psalm 82:3-4 NIV  

* God cares about children more than we can imagine.  

_A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling. God sets the lonely in families..._  
Psalm 68:5-6 NIV  

* We're all adopted into God's family. 

_God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure._  
Ephesians 1:5 NLT

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* Kids say and do the funniest things. Who’s got a story?
* Do you celebrate Mother’s Day weekend? How?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* How would your life look different if you believed you were God's "Plan A" to care for people without families?
* Read James 1:27. Why do you think widows and orphans are highlighted specifically?
* What are some ways people could address this issue beyond actually fostering or adopting?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* Who do you know who's involved in foster care or adoption? How can you support them?
* Have you or someone you’re close to experienced fostering or adoption in some way? How have you been impacted?
* How do you feel called to respond? What bold step will you pray about making?

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about caring for children.</p> 

[Mark 9:37](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/mark.9.37.niv) [Mark 10:13-14](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/mark.10.13-14.niv) [Isaiah 1:17](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/isa.1.17.niv) [Psalm 127:3-5](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.127.3-5.niv)

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

Heavenly Father, You adopted us into Your family. We want to open our hearts and homes to kids who need Your love. Will You speak to each of us about what we can do? Amen.
