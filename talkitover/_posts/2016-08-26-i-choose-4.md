Key Scriptures

_As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to [Jesus] and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!”_  
Luke 10:38-40 NIV

## Choosing the Important

1. Create artificial deadlines
2. Be ruthlessly selective in your “yeses.”
3. Do first what matters most.

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* If you got two extra hours each day, what would you do more of?
* Which word best describes your last few weeks? Relaxed, busy, full, fun, rewarding. Why?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* Read Luke 10:38-40. Do you identify with Mary or Martha? Explain.
* Why do you think we’re tempted to allow urgent things to rule our lives?
* Craig said busyness does not equal productivity. What busyness can you cut out of your life?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* Name three urgent things you need to do and three important things you need to do. Which are getting more of your time?
* Do you have a process or trick that reminds you to choose important over urgent? Share an example.
* What’s the most important thing you’ve been too distracted to pursue? What do you need to stop doing to pursue it?

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray with power.</p> 

_Jesus, You lived a short life here on earth yet accomplished the most important work of all. Thank You. Will You give us the strength to think long-term and people-first? Will You help us to refocus on what matters most? Amen._

## Live It Out
