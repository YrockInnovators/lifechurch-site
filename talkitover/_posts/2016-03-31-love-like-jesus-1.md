## Forgives Sinners

<p class="lead">Think back through Craig’s message. What sticks out?</p> 

Key Scriptures

￼_For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins._  
Matthew 6:14-15 NIV

_Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with [Jesus] to be executed. When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left. Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”_  
Luke 23:32-34 NIV
