Key Scriptures

_For everything there is a season, a time for every activity under heaven._   
Ecclesiastes 3:1 NLT  

_This is the day the LORD has made; We will rejoice and be glad in it._   
Psalm 118:24 NKJV

[Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 NLT](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/ecc.3.1-8.nlt) [Psalm 39:4-5](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.39.4-5.niv)

This week’s movie is all about time—time travel, to be specific. Tim finds out he can time travel, and he uses his ability to fall in love with Mary. Despite his special powers, he discovers the most important time is now.

"We’re going to live in the present, find joy in the ordinary, purpose in the mundane, and meaning in the moment!"

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start Talking: find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* Of all superpowers (including time travel) which would you pick? Why?
* If you were Tim, would you have done anything differently?

<p class="lead">Start Thinking: ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* Do you see time differently now from when you were younger? How has your perspective changed?
* If you could relive every day, what would you spend the most time doing over?
* Did any scene really hit you? What does it inspire in you?
 
<p class="lead">Start Sharing: choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* Tell a story of a time you wish you could travel back to.
* What are some ways you can live like each day is a gift?
* Think of your last really good day. Share your experiences, and discuss as a group what might have set this day apart.
* List out loud two or three people, activities, or things you’d spend more time on if you could time travel. How will you make these a priority today? This week?

<p class="lead">Start Praying: be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

* God, we haven’t always spent our time in the best ways. We’re thankful You’re the Author of time, and You can do in a day what no man could do in a thousand years. Starting now, we commit our days—past, present, and future—to You. Amen.

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">Start Doing: commit to a step, and live it out this week.</p>

* Make time for the Maker of time. Each day this week, read Psalm 118:24 and talk with God.
* Pretend you can time travel. Make a simple list of what you wish you had done differently last week. Then, do it this week!
* Call or message the most important people in your life, and set up some time to spend together.
