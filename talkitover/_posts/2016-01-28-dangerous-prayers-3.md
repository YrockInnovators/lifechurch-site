## Send Me
<p class="lead">Think back through Craig’s message. What sticks out to you?</p> 

Key Scriptures

_Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?” And I said, “Here am I. Send me!”_  
Isaiah 6:8 NIV

[Jonah 1:1-3](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jon.1.1-3.niv)  
[Exodus 3:10](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/exo.3.10.niv)  
[Isaiah 6:1-8](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/isa.6.1-8.niv)

Three Responses to God’s Call

1. Jonah: Here I am. I’m **not going**.
2. Moses: Here I am. Send **someone else**.
3. Isaiah: Here I am. Send **me**.  

What do you need to fully surrender to God?  

1. A genuine experience with the **presence** of God.
2. A genuine awareness of your **sinfulness**.
3. A genuine understanding of God’s **grace**.

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">Start talking. Find a conversation starter for your group.</p> 

* Name a place you’d love to be sent to and a place you’d never want to be sent to. Why?
* Which has been an anchor message for you: _Search Me_, _Break Me_, or _Send Me_?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* Do your prayers revolve more around what God can do for you or what you can do for God? Give an example of how you’d like to be praying.
* List some typical excuses people give for not going to the places—or doing the work—God calls them to.
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* Which do you most lack: genuine experience with God, awareness of your sinfulness, or understanding of His grace?
* Talk about the last time you felt compelled to do something out of your norm. How did you respond? Could it have been God sending you?
* Currently, do you most identify with Jonah, Moses, or Isaiah? What might be keeping you from full surrender to God?
* Just like brokenness, being sent is not a one-time experience. To what or where are you being sent now?

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

* Lord, here we are. Make us aware of our brokenness. Show us Your grace, God. And, send us to the people and places where You need us. Amen.

<p class="lead">Start digging. Read Scripture about surrender.</p>
