## It Will Happen
<p class="lead">Start by reviewing this week’s key points.</p> 

[Hebrews 10:36](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/heb.10.36.niv)

[Acts 27:9-11](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/act.27.9-11.niv)

The outcome is God’s responsibility. **Obedience** is yours.

[Acts 27:12-26](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/act.27.12-26.niv)

_"Will I steer by my senses, or will I steer by the Spirit?"_

## Discussion Questions
<p class="lead">How far do you want to take your group? Choose from these suggestions to tailor the discussion to suit your group.</p>

* What’s the craziest/funniest thing you’ve heard following the phrase, “The Lord told me”?
* Tell a story of when God spoke direction into your life. Did it make sense right away? How did you realize it was God?
* Do you lean on your senses or on God’s promises? What comforts would you have to give up to rely more on God?
* Is God whispering any warnings to you that could keep you out of a storm?
* Are any parts of your life drifting on autopilot or run aground like Paul’s ship?
* Is God asking you to abandon something that’s sinking you?
* How will the storm you’re facing now change the way you face a storm later?
* Are you worshipping the way you want God to do it, or the God who said He would do it? Discuss how to practically live out the latter.
* What would you have to give up to take advantage of a “but now” do-over?

## Live It Out
<p class="lead">End with a challenge to take action. Choose a closing question to help each person identify their next steps.</p>

* Do you need to obey a warning, discard cargo, abandon ship, or take a do-over to swim to shore? Share what you’re facing and pray together.
* Take responsibility for your spirit with this 10-day Bible reading plan: [go2.lc/responsibility](https://www.bible.com/reading-plans/1336-my-spirit-my-responsibility)
* Practice hearing and obeying whispers from the Holy Spirit this week. Text each other with stories of obedience.
