Key Scripture

_"**Do not judge, or you too will be judged.** For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."_  
Matthew 7:1-2 NIV    

### What Is Clear About Judging  

1. Never judge **superficially**.  
[John 7:24](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/joh.7.24.niv)
2. Never judge **hypocritically**.  
[Romans 2:1-4](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rom.2.1-4.niv)
3. Never hold non-Christians to **Christian** standards.  
[1 Corinthians 5:12](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1co.5.12.niv)
4. Always help other believers who have fallen to be **restored**.  
[Galatians 6:1-2](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/gal.6.1-2.niv)

* Who’s your favorite reality TV judge? What would it be like for you to be judged by them?

<p class="lead">Start thinking. Ask questions to get your group thinking.</p> 

* Describe a time when you judged someone superficially. Why do you think it’s so easy to do?
* Why are superficial judgments harmful to relationships?
* How would you define a hypocrite? How do you think people become hypocritical?
 
<p class="lead">Start sharing. Choose questions that create openness.</p> 

* What are the situations in your life where you feel most judged? When are you most judgmental of others?
* Which of Pastor Craig’s four points are most difficult for you to live out? Why?
* Do you ever have standards for others that you struggle to meet yourself? If so, what’s another alternative?
* Do you lean more toward grace or truth? How is God using this teaching to help you grow?
* Read Galatians 6:1-2. Discuss the type of relationship that would be necessary for this kind of restoration.

<p class="lead">Start praying. Be bold, and pray specifically.</p> 

* Jesus, if anyone has the right to judge, it’s You. Yet You came to save the world, not to condemn it. As we become more like You, will You teach us to restore the people around us, not to destroy them? Thank You for Your grace to save us. Amen.
