Key Scriptures

_... Always work enthusiastically for the Lord, for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless._ 
1 Corinthians 15:58 NLT  

[1 Corinthians 15:57](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1co.15.57.niv) [Colossians 3:23](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/col.3.23.niv)[1 Samuel 17:45-46, 48](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1sa.17.45-46, 48.niv)[2 Samuel 11:1-2](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2sa.11.1-2.niv) [Revelation 2:4-5](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/rev.2.4-5.niv) [Psalm 51:10,12](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.51.10,12.niv)

### Where Did David's Enthusiasm Come From?

* He **trusted** God daily.
* He **walked** with God daily.
* He **worshipped** God daily.

### Two Seasons of David's Life
1. With enthusiasm, David **ran** into the battle to serve his **God**.
2. With apathy, David **walked** on the roof to serve his **comfort**.

"Enthusiasm isn't just a mood. It's a spiritual result of an intimate relationship with God."
