  description_small: Just because God's silent doesn’t mean He’s not there. When God

  description_medium: Life doesn’t always go the way we expected. You pray with faith,
    but God doesn’t do what you asked. You seek Him, but don’t feel His presence.
    You’re going through pain, but your cries for relief seem to go unanswered. What
    do you do When God Doesn’t Make Sense?

  description_medium: Temptation is the seductive little voice that twists what you
    want into what you need. It distorts your thoughts until you’re trapped—and when
    you’re trapped by temptation, it’s not the time to listen to yourself. Put your
    trust in someone who knows A Way Out.

    on the corner, or even the papers you stapled? He was there. Join LifeChurch.tv
