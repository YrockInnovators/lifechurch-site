    our nature rebels against Him.  Regardless of which path we choose-obedience or
    rebellion- God is the God of second chances. Few stories illustrate this principle
    more clearly than the story of Jonah.  Join us as we delve into the story of one
    man and his journey towards surrender.

    good sex, bad sex, and great sex?  And what about those awkward topics that few
    people discuss openly?  Weve come a long way since the days when TV couples like
    Ward and June Cleaver slept in separate beds... and today's kids aren't nearly
    as innnocent as Wally and the Beaver.  Sometimes it's the things you have to unlearn
    about sex that help you understand what great sex really is.

  description_medium: Are you satisfied? Would you be satisfied with more? King Solomon
    had all the riches in the world, but still he sought more. More money, more sex,
    more power. And what he found is that the problem with having everything in the
    world…is having everything in the world. Explore the book of Ecclesiastes as Solomon’s
    personal discovery that, even though he tried and he tried…he couldn’t get no
    satisfaction. His ultimate conclusion was that following God and His commandments
    is all that matters.

    the realm of a pastor’s life: insecurities, doubts, and weariness....frustrations,
    concerns and mistakes. In "Confessions of a Pastor," Pastor Craig opens up in
    hopes of shattering any false pretenses. What is it like to be a pastor? Probably
    a lot like being anyone else. Let go of the expectations and high standards that
    are keeping you in bondage and let God start to become one of your truest friends
    through your own confessions.'

    did not send Jesus to make us religious. As we study the book of Galatians, learn
    how to avoid the prison of religion and live in the freedom of Christ.

  description_small: 
  description_medium: Christmas is always thought of as the best time of the year.
    Unfortunately, as we go through life we often experience family and relational
    pain, and Christmas can go from being the highlight of the year to the most difficult
    time. In this three-part study, we learn how to forgive others, how to ask for
    forgiveness, and what it means to be forgiven.
