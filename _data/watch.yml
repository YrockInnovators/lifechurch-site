  headline: Life doesn’t always go the way we expected. What do you do When God Doesn’t
    Make Sense?
  description_small: Just because God's silent doesn’t mean He’s not there. When God
    Doesn’t Make Sense might just be the time to trust Him the most.
  description_medium: Life doesn’t always go the way we expected. You pray with faith,
    but God doesn’t do what you asked. You seek Him, but don’t feel His presence.
    You’re going through pain, but your cries for relief seem to go unanswered. What
    do you do When God Doesn’t Make Sense?

  description_small: Where do you turn when temptation changes what you want into
    what you need? Maybe it’s time to trust in someone who knows A Way Out.
  description_medium: Temptation is the seductive little voice that twists what you
    want into what you need. It distorts your thoughts until you’re trapped—and when
    you’re trapped by temptation, it’s not the time to listen to yourself. Put your
    trust in someone who knows A Way Out.

  title: God Never Said That
  headline: Those "words of wisdom" can be deceiving. Don’t get swept away by things
    God never said.
  description_small: If it sounds true, it must be in the Bible, right? Don’t be fooled
    by your favorite phrases. You might be surprised to learn God Never Said That.
  description_medium: 'We love offering little nuggets of advice, support, or sympathy.
    They come in handy when we want people to feel better. But what if the guidance
    you’re giving or receiving just isn’t true? What if God Never Said That? '
